# ShopifyChallenge

Hello,

My Name is Mayukh and here are my solutions to the Fall 2021 Data Science Intern Challenge.

Question 1 is provided in 3 different formats:
  1. Jupyter Notebook
  2. HTML
  3. Python
  
Question 2 is SQL queries and have been provided as a txt file.

It was a really interesting challenge and I learnt a lot while completing it. I want to thank you for giving me an opportunity to participate.

I would also request you to check one of the other projects I did during the summer it is called [Check My Carrots](https://github.com/mayukh3333/CheckMyCarrots) and is a fake news detector I built.

Thank You for going through my application.

Regards
Mayukh Dewan
